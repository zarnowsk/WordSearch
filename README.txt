Welcome to Word Search. This application is designed to allow the 
user to create a square grid containing letters of the English 
alphabet, and then finding words on the grid in all directions 
(horizontally, vertically, and diagonally). As a user, you are first 
able to decide on the size of the grid. With available choices 
between 5 and 15, your selection will create a grid containing chosen 
number of letters across and down (in a square). You are also able to 
add a difficulty factor by ticking the “Master Difficulty” checkbox. 
This will change the letter distribution from 1/3 vowel, 2/3 
consonants to completely random distribution of vowels and consonants. 
Once you are happy with your choices, hit “Generate” and enjoy the game!


***** ***** ***** ***** *****  HOW TO PLAY  ***** ***** ***** ***** *****

1. In welcome window, select your board size. If you're up for a challange
   increase the difficulty level by checking the "Master Difficulty" check
   box.
2. Once ready to play, click on the "Generate" button to create your grid.
3. The game window should appear. Upper menu strip allows you to change 
   game settings such as the theme or display of reversed words and also
   allows for interaction with the matched words list (see explanation 
   below). 
4. To play the game, simply type in a word you'd like to search for into
   the text box located in the middle of the upper controls section of the
   board. Click the "Find Word" button. If your word exists on the board, 
   its location will be highlighted and it'll be added to the "Matched 
   Words" list. If multiple matches exist, they will all be highlighted but
   only one copy will be added to matched words list. If the word doesn't 
   appear in the grid, "NO MATCHES FOUND" text will appear.
5. You are able to change the letters displayed in the grid if you are not
   happy with them. Simply click the "Re-generate Letters" button located
   on the left side of the upper controls area. Please note, this will not
   clear your already matched words.
